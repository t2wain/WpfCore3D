## Cable Tray Network in 3D View

![WpfApp](./TrayNetwork3D.png)

In engineering, we need to route cables between two equipments along the cable tray network. Designer typically models the equipment and the cable trays in a plant design CAD software like Hexagon Smart 3D or AVEVA E3D. The models are then exported as lines and nodes with 3D coordinates for the nodes. Such data now can be plotted as lines and points to provide a represented view of the cable tray network and the highlighted routes of cables between equipments along the cable tray network.
